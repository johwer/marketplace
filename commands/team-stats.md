# Team Stats — Dream Team Leaderboard & History

## Workflow

1. **Read the history file** — look for `dream-team-history.json` in your project memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`). Search for the directory matching your current project. If it doesn't exist, tell the user no sessions have been recorded yet.

2. **Calculate and display stats** in this format:
